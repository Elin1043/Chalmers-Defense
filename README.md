## Known Issues
### Mac OS
* Currently the application does not work properly for macOS. The program is able to start and run but a problem occurs regarding the circle around the towers. They appear slightly oval and the positioning is incorrect.
* Changing from fullscreen to window mode on a Mac causes the program to crash.

Note: Same problems as above can be expected for Linux.

### Scaling
* When exiting the fullscreen mode the text sometimes becomes hard to read because of a scaling issue with libGDX.
